# Tensorflow-Object-Detection-api-with-dlib-KCF-Tracking
This repository contains a program that can run the object detector every few frames and track the bounding boxes with dlib kcf tracker. The purpose is to reduce the computational load and increase the run-speed of the program. 

# Setup
If the Tensorflow object detection api has already been set up in your device, just simply download the once_a_while.py file and paste it to your directory.
If the Tensorflow object detection api has not been set up, you may use the link in the Download.txt file to download what you need to run the program. You may find the setup step helpful in here: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection.
